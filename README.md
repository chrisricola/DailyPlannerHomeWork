The date and time is thru moment(), which gives the current date time. As the time goes by it runs thru the for loop, which states that the start time is 9am and final hour is 6pm which give 5pm the full hour. As the hour pass, it runs thru css and changes color of the row. The row is broken down with three colums in html thru bootstrap. There is the text area which is the value once the save button is clicked. The hour is the key and the text the value in local storage. Then the bottom formula pull the value of the text and renders to the page. So it persist on load.
